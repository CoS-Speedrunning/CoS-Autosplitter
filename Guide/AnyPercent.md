# Setup
## Using the autosplitter
The autosplitter is available via LiveSplit itself. Right-click on the timer and click "Edit Splits...", then after typing in game name, a button will show up to activate the splitter.
Settings allow you to switch between Any% and True Ending splitting modes. It is recommended to keep all other checks active, unless you find a skip or a different route that skips a split trigger.
## Input methods
The fastest completion of the game requires using both a gamepad and a mouse. 
A gamepad allows for more control over movement, avoiding slow walking almost completely and allowing certain glitches, like the stairboost.
Mouse is necessary to quickly complete puzzles that require moving objects around the screen, including translating languages to link the civilizations in True Ending.
People playing on console or those that don't have a gamepad can still run the game without any issues, however mouse-only runners will accumulate time loss caused by movement imperfections throughout the run, and gamepad-only runners will suffer from some single major time losses on certain puzzles that with mouse can be done in an instant.
## For the run to be valid...
Make sure that you have OBS game overlay capturing enabled. You must enable your Steam overlay FPS counter and put it in a visible corner. If the game does not automatically limit your framerate to your monitor's refresh rate, you must use a frame limiter tool and set it to 165FPS. *To do: Give some tool recommendations.*
## Other recommendations
It is recommended to use an input display. For mouse, it's [NohBoard](https://github.com/ThoNohT/NohBoard/releases/latest) ([setup instructions](https://github.com/ThoNohT/NohBoard/wiki/How-To-Use)), and for gamepad it's [Gamepad Viewer](https://gamepadviewer.com/#about). This is for both you and other runners to be able to learn better from existing runs, and also a method to better examine existing glitches and find out how to perform those that are yet to discover.
# The run
The following list is divided by the split names from the file in Resources tab provided by us.
A gamepad is assumed as the optimal input method unless otherwise stated.
This guide assumes you know the path to different locations in-game. If you're in doubt, watch current world record.
## Crypt
### First journal
- Time starts on your first input. Follow the path to the first door.
- When you reach the level, interact with it a short while after the popup opens.
	- Don't interact immediately, because the game will walk you closer instead of opening the window instantly.
	- Don't walk all the way to it, because the animation of walking to the lever to pull it always takes the same amount of time - you'll waste time doing unnecessary distance.
- After you opened the lever window, **D-pad Left, then press A**. Walk through the opened door.
- Pull the levers in the following order: **6 - 4 - 3 - 1**. Walk to the other side of the bridge until the journal opens.
- This is the only journal page the game forces you to fill in. Press **Down, Down, A, A, Up, Up, A, A, Down, A, A** to do it the quickest way.
### Crypt exit
- There isn't much room to save time here - the game forces you to watch a lot of cutscenes and perform a lot of movement. You can only use a few strategies that **will be useful throughout the whole run**:
	- Make sure that you are **walking at full speed when interacting** with the puzzles and NPCs - this way you don't slow down, but are moved to the destination point instantly. *This is known as **Slow walk bypass**.*
	- When in dialogues, you can proceed after all the lines appear **and** the NPCs finishes the animation. This is good to know to save your thumb and the buttons from unnecessary presses.
	- When in journal, you can close it after all newly discovered glyphs appear.
- When you finish the water puzzle, slow walk bypass when interacting with that NPC is quite tricky:
	- Move from the last lever you pulled to the platform with the exit, but stop right after crossing the last bridge.
	- Wait for the NPC to reach his destination and almost finish rotating.
	- Start walking towards the NPC. Interact with him only after you're very close to him to make sure you have reached the maximum speed.
## Abbey
### Hide and seek
- Follow the path to the observation deck, where you'll encounter the child.
- Play hide and seek with the child.
	- The first interaction point is next to the corner of the building.
	- The second interaction point is parallel to the fence.
	- The third interaction point is next to the pots.
	- Use slow walk bypass on all three.
- Continue to the passage opened by the child.
### Coin
- Wait for the child to show you how to sneak.
- Press **B once** to allow your character to move freely (unhug it from the walls).
	- *Pressing **B** twice will make us stop crouching.*
- Throw the rock. Press B and start moving towards the exit.
	- This is the visual clue for when to start moving. *Insert image here*.
- Interact with the child immediately. Then go left to find the key, and then use the key.
- Go 2 rooms right towards the bed puzzle.
- **STAIRBOOST** - when entering the room, but before gaining full control, move your character slightly left on the stairs (upwards on camera).
	- Video examples can be found here: [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEctsxCiW1Q&list=PLp1tsi2hn9JYVK424IZbs-rToBqulKPN_), [Ideal performance](https://www.twitch.tv/thedoczek/clip/DeterminedYummyKittenGingerPower-aeCJvzeT1ze3ZXnj)
	- *Stairboost is a framerate-dependent glitch that occurs when an entrance to a room starts with an elevation difference. When we are not on the height the game expects us to be when giving us full control, it launches us forwards.*
- Solve the bed puzzle. This video (*To do: Make the video*) shows the optimal order in which the beds should be moved and sides from which they should be grabbed. Try to **make use of slow walk bypass** as often as possible.
### Church
- Exit the room the way you entered it. Go to the church via the garden - up, left, up.
- **Don't** interact with the beggar yet.
- Solve the puzzle using mouse and enter the church.
### Lens
- Walk towards the alter until you reach the further bronze line on the floor, then go back to the exit.
	- There aren't any good visual clues on where exactly to turn around, it's mostly feeling.
	- If the cutscene plays before reaching the exit, you succeeded.
- Now give the coin to the beggar and pick the note from him.
- Go to the garden and find the key.
- Open the preacher's room and pick up the lens.
### Abbey exit
- Go to the cemetery.
- Rotate the devotee once, the man twice, the preacher 5 times and the instrument 4 times.
	- Start from the devotee. After that, it doesn't matter if you go clockwise or counter-clockwise.
- Enter the cave and fire up the wood. (Another place where you can take the advantage of slow walk bypass.)
- Enter the maze. Go: **Up, Right, Up, Left, Up, Right**. Pull the lever and go back to the exit.
	- Two first turns can be swapped.
- Leave the area.
## Fortress
### Spear
- *Potential stairboost opportunity - A stairboost is theoretically possible here. However, the awkward camera angle and the narrowness of the stairs make it very hard, if not impossible. So far it has been succeeded on banned framerates only.*
- Follow the path to the room with the shield and pick up the spear there.
### Reaching the stealth section
- Just reach it.
- Some strategies in the next section are quite hard to describe without a video - we recommend watching current world record alongside reading the following parts.
### Stealth split 1 - Long corridor
- *Using mouse here is slightly safer at the cost of a minimal time loss.*
- Sneak past the first guard.
- After the second guard passes a certain point, walk towards bottom left corner of the structure in the middle, then after waiting a while, walk towards the exit.
	- Runners use tile edges on the floor as a visual reference for when to move.
- *Switch back to gamepad.*
- Follow the long corridor until you see the gong.
- **GONG SKIP** - Wait until second-to-last row of the warriors **fully** crosses a tile edge on the ground. Then run to the wall on the left until you are mostly covered by it, then run back to the right and up to commit suicide.
	- You **must** reach the checkpoint trigger **before** suspiciousness marker turns red - otherwise the checkpoint won't activate!
- **Switch to mouse here**. After you respawn, walk to the left edge of the wall you're next to, then sneak straight into the exit. A full video of the gong skip is available here (*To do: make the video*).
### Stealth split 2 - Storage room
- **Switch back to gamepad.** Spam **B** upon entering this room, then follow to the elevator and enter the next room.
- **ELEVATOR SKIP** - Walk straight to the boxes on the far left side of the room. **Switch to mouse here.** When the warrior crosses the first tile edge while going right, press right between the tile edges, as close to the wall as possible. When the warrior comes to a stop, click as close to the corner between the wall and the fence to the right, and exit the room as soon as you're in front of the exit.
	- Video example can be found [here](https://youtu.be/LpR1X4zPrL4).
	- This strategy is possible on gamepad, but it's much tighter and it doesn't save time.
	- A safer strategy is available: Lift the elevator up. When the warrior is moving to the right, click right below the middle diamond on the elevator floor. Go to the exit the moment the warrior starts moving left.
### Stealth split 3 - The big hall
- **Switch back to gamepad**. Continue to the gong in the big hall.
- **CYCLE SKIP** - Throw the rock when the warrior pushing the cart crosses the tile edge in the top left corner of the screen, above the small chimney. Right when you are covered by the cart, **Press B ONCE** and start running to the exit.
	- Alternatively, you can wait slightly longer after throwing the rock and then wait for the next cycle of the guard next to the exit.
- Wear a disguise: Press **A, Up, A, Left, Left, A**.
### Fortress exit
- Follow the path to the bells.
- The bell pattern is as follows: **1 - 3 - 4 - 2 - 4** (where 1 is the bottommost bell).
- Reach the next area.
## Gardens
### Servant door
- A bug causes the character to be pushed back if an input is made with the controller shortly after reaching the top. **Use mouse to get to the next room**.
- Reach the leftmost room, then wait for the servant to open the door for you.
- **Pushing into the door** while they are being opened will make you enter the next room instantly.
### Reaching the Sewers
- Reach the workshop and pick up the hammer.
- Go back and talk with the servant for the first time.
- Give the hammer to the servant.
	- *Staying in one place is faster than attempting a slow walk bypass here - you would have to go back to gain speed.*
- Enter the sewers.
### In the sewers
- Go **Left, Down, Right, Down, Down, Down, Right, Right, Down**.
- Pick up the compass.
- Exit the way you came.
### Windmill
- Follow the path to the windmill.
- Talk to the 3 bards. The standing point is on the yellow channel next to them.
- Complete the obstacle course.
### Maze
- Reach the maze.
- Go **West, North, East, South, West**.
	- In each room, press X to pull out the compass and press B to close it.
	- *You can lose 1 second to RNG each time you have to go to the opposite side of the room instead of turning. You can lose a maximum of 5 seconds and 1.67 seconds are lost on average.*
## Factory
### Monster
- Reach the monster.
- Complete first stealth room as normal.
- In the second stealth room, commit suicide as soon as you gain control. This will respawn the monster in a more convenient bottom right corner.
- From there, sneak to the small wall to the right of the monster. Press B once the monster starts moving and run to the rock pile.
	- *This is supposed to have a 2/3 rate of success - after respawning, the monster can go top left, bottom left and bottom middle, and you don't make it in time when it goes bottom middle. However, not a single runner had the monster go bottom middle in the run, and there had been quite a few runs. I have no idea what's happening, but I don't complain.*
- Throw the rock, then instantly spam B and pull the lever.
- Finish the monster section.
### Triggering the timer
- Activate the elevator and ride it, then ride the other elevator to the second floor and head to the canteen.
- After that, the canteen will be closed for 3 minutes and 30 seconds of in-game time, and then will start a cycle of being open for 1 minute and closed for 4 minutes. Before the canteen opens, we will do everything that does not require an item from the canteen.
### Waiting for the canteen
*Note that there is more room for error on this split - doing everything correctly leaves us with around 20 seconds of wait time.*
- After entering the canteen front yard, exit back immediately and head back to the first floor.
- Go left towards the minecart and ride it. Then complete the obstacle course.
- Activate the silver melter.
	- **Press D-pad Left, Hold A and press D-pad Right.**
	- Don't pump the lever - it won't stay that way.
- Continue right and pick up the gold bar.
- Continue down and pick up keycards from the third locker.
- Head to the second floor, to the transformation room.
- Insert gold bar to the 2nd slot.
- Measure weights:
	- **Carbon (4th slot) - All top row weights minus 3**
	- **Gold (2nd slot) - All bottom row weights plus 5**
- Head to the canteen.
- You should be early for the canteen to open. If that's the case, head bottom right and enter the staircase there just before canteen opens. As soon as you hear the bell, go back.
	- *Doing that is faster than waiting for the cutscene of alchemists entering the canteen.*
- Pick up silverware.
### Silver bar
- Head left, then go back to the first floor, to the gold mine.
- Use the silver melter. **Pump the lever first**, then insert what you picked up in the canteen.
### Factory exit
- Head to the transformation room again. Insert silver bar to the first slot.
- Measure weights:
	- **Silver (1st slot) - Three middle bottom row weights plus 12**
- Make the key, then head left and open the door.
## Exile
### Keypad
- Head up, then left to the gold terminal.
- Open it, but don't complete it. **While it's open, press Y and change the tab to Anchorite language.**
	- *These terminals contain some undiscovered Alchemist glyph. This avoids waiting for them to pop up.*
- Head left until you see another gold terminal. Do the same thing.
- Head left again. **Use mouse for the mask room**. Find the gold terminal and do the same thing.
- Head back to the door you passed while going to the second terminal.
- Press **Y** to update the glyphs.
- If you haven't hovered over the Exile symbol on the way, the glyphs should be here:
- ![[dooropen.png]]
### Exile key
- Enter the room and interact with the screen.
- ![[one.png]]
- ![[two.png]]
- ![[three.png]]
- Wait for the cutscenes to end. (Spam B.)
### The tower
- Just head to the tower. Time ends when you press the button on the top.
