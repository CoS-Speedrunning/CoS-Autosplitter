# Chants of Sennaar Autosplitter v0.2.0

## Known bugs
- Some splits will trigger multiple times during true ending run

## How to install
1. [Download](https://github.com/just-ero/asl-help/raw/main/lib/asl-help) `asl-help` and place it in your LiveSplit installation folder > Components
    - E.g. Documents\LiveSplit_1.8.26\Components
2. Place `chantsofsennaar.asl` and `chantsofsennaar.Settings.xml` in the same folder as `asl-help` above.
3. Import the autosplitter into Livesplit
    - Right-click > Edit Layout > plus button to add > Control > Scriptable Auto Splitter > Browse > select the .asl file
4. If advanced settings appear, you'll know the installation was successful. You can customize the save slot and the splits.
5. If you want to switch between Any% and True Ending modes, you don't have to uncheck individual splits - you can just uncheck the category split.
## Current functionalities
- Automatic save slot detection
- Selecting between Any% and True Ending categories
- Selecting individual splits (reccomended to keep them all on)
